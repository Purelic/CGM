# CGM - Custom Game Manager

A note from Reggie:
> This plugin was intially created in 2015 as a project to learn how to code Java through Minecraft plugins. Over the years it has been added to without ever really going back and refactoring the entire project to follow better coding standards/practices. Some of the code may be messy, but it works and ultimately this is just a fun side project for me, so as of right now I don't have plans to clean it up entirely.
